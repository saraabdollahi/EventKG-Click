About Dataset



EventKG+Click is a novel cross-lingual dataset that reflects the language-specic relevance of events and their relations. This dataset aims to provide a reference source to train and evaluate novel models for event-centric cross-lingual user interaction, with a particular focus on the models supported by knowledge graphs. EventKG+Click Dataset is based on two data sources:


1) the Wikipedia clickstream that reflects real-world user interactions with events and their relations within language-specic Wikipedia editions; and
2) the EventKG knowledge graph that contains semantic information regarding events
and their relations that partially originates from Wikipedia.


EventKG+Click consists of two subsets: 


1. EventKG+Click_event which contains relevance scores, location-closeness, recency and Wikipedia link count factors for more than 4 thousand events; and

2. EventKG+Click_relation with nearly 10 thousand event-centric click-through pairs, and their langugae specific number of clicks, relation relevance and co-mentions of the relation which is the number of sentences in whole Wikipedia language editions that mentions both the source and target.
